# hackbot
##Discord bot for Hackathon
###This bot is a continueing project and I welcome pull requests that improve/fix or add features

*Feel free to take the code and create your own bot to host
*One thing to note is that I created a file called token1.py to keep my token in with a function def stringToken(): that just returns the token string. I added that to the .gitignore because discord will make the token no longer work if it finds it on the internet
